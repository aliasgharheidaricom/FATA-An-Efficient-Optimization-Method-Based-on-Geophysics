## 📖 Overview
Introducing an **efficient** and **innovative** swarm intelligence algorithm: the **Fata Morgana Algorithm (FATA)**. This algorithm is meticulously designed to tackle **complex continuous multi-type optimization problems**. 

Inspired by the captivating phenomenon of **mirage formation**, FATA ingeniously implements two key strategies:
- **Mirage Light Filtering Principle (MLF)**: Enhances exploration through innovative filtering techniques.
- **Light Propagation Strategy (LPS)**: Accelerates convergence with effective propagation methods.

The MLF strategy, synergistically combined with the robust definite integration principle, significantly enhances FATA’s remarkable exploration capability. Concurrently, the LPS strategy, artfully integrated with trigonometric principles, empowers each algorithmic individual to markedly improve the algorithm's convergence speed and exceptional exploitation capability. 

These two sophisticated search strategies work together to ensure a balanced and effective optimization process.

FATA has been rigorously compared against a diverse range of competitive optimizers across **23 benchmark functions** and the **IEEE CEC 2014** to validate its outstanding optimization prowess. This groundbreaking work is designed for:
- Comprehensive qualitative analysis
- Exploration and exploitation competency evaluation
- Local optima avoidance strategies
- Extensive comparative experiments

The experimental results compellingly demonstrate the **robustness**, **comprehensiveness**, and **competitiveness** of FATA in effectively solving various multi-type functions. Additionally, FATA has been successfully applied to three challenging practical engineering optimization problems, where it consistently outperforms its counterparts, showcasing its practical utility and effectiveness. 

The promising results indicate that FATA possesses remarkable potential as a powerful computer-aided tool for addressing complex practical optimization tasks. Source codes and related files are readily available at the [FATA Project Page](https://aliasgharheidari.com/FATA.html) and other platforms.
