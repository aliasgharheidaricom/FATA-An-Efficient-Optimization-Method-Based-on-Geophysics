# FATA Optimization (Version 1.0)

## Overview
Introducing an exceptionally efficient and innovative swarm intelligence algorithm, the fata morgana algorithm (FATA), meticulously designed to tackle complex continuous multi-type optimization problems. Inspired by the captivating phenomenon of mirage formation, FATA ingeniously implements the mirage light filtering principle (MLF) and the light propagation strategy (LPS). The MLF strategy, synergistically combined with the robust definite integration principle, propels the algorithmic population to significantly enhance FATA‚Äôs remarkable exploration capability. Concurrently, the LPS strategy, artfully integrated with trigonometric principles, empowers each algorithmic individual to markedly improve the algorithm's convergence speed and exceptional exploitation capability. These two sophisticated search strategies synergistically optimize FATA‚Äôs population and individual search functions, ensuring a balanced and effective optimization process.

FATA has been rigorously compared against a diverse range of competitive optimizers across 23 benchmark functions and the IEEE CEC 2014 to validate its outstanding optimization prowess. This groundbreaking work is meticulously designed for comprehensive qualitative analysis, exploration and exploitation competency evaluation, local optima avoidance strategies, and extensive comparative experiments. The experimental results compellingly demonstrate the robustness, comprehensiveness, and competitiveness of FATA in effectively solving various multi-type functions. Additionally, FATA has been successfully applied to three challenging practical engineering optimization problems, where it consistently outperforms its counterparts, showcasing its practical utility and effectiveness. The promising results indicate that FATA possesses remarkable potential as a powerful computer-aided tool for addressing complex practical optimization tasks.
